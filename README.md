## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd bsh
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   - Fill in your EmailJS values in `.env`:
   ```env
   VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
   VITE_EMAILJS_CONTACT_TEMPLATE_ID=your_contact_template_id
   VITE_EMAILJS_APPOINTMENT_TEMPLATE_ID=your_appointment_template_id
   ```
   - Sign up at [emailjs.com](https://emailjs.com) if you haven't already
   - **Never commit the `.env` file** — it is git-ignored

### Development

Start the development server with hot reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Build for Production

Create an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Preview Production Build

Preview the production build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## 📧 Email Configuration

The website uses EmailJS for automated email notifications. Two types of emails are supported:

### Contact Form Emails
When a visitor fills the contact form, an email is sent to `info@basespecialisthospital.com` with:
- Visitor's name and email
- Phone number
- Department/Category
- Urgency level
- Message content
- Reply-to address for easy responses

### Appointment Booking Emails
When a visitor books an appointment, an email is sent with:
- Patient's name and email
- Selected service
- Preferred appointment date/time
- Additional message (optional)
- Reply-to address

**Note**: Appointment dates must be at least 24 hours from the current time.

### Setting Up EmailJS

Detailed instructions are available in the code comments within `src/services/emailService.js`. Quick setup:

1. Create account at emailjs.com
2. Add your email service (SMTP)
3. Create email templates with the provided template variables
4. Copy your service ID and public key
5. Update the configuration in emailService.js

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors & Branding
- Primary color: `--bsh-primary` (defined in CSS)
- Secondary color: `--bsh-secondary`
- Accent color: `--bsh-accent`
- Update these in your CSS files to rebrand

### Hospital Information
Edit `src/data/hospital-info.json` to update:
- Hospital name and contact details
- Phone numbers
- Email addresses
- Address and location
- Working hours
- Social media links

### Services
Add or modify services in `src/data/services.json`:
- Service title and description
- Icons and images
- Features and benefits

### Doctors
Update doctor information in `src/data/doctors.json`:
- Name, role, and specialties
- Education and experience
- Contact information
- Profile images

### Blog Posts
Manage blog content in `src/data/blog.json`:
- Title, slug, and content
- Author and date
- Featured image

## 🔄 Router Configuration

The application uses Vue Router with hash-based scrolling for smooth navigation to specific sections. Routes are configured in `src/router/index.js`:

- `/` - Home page
- `/about` - About page
- `/services` - Services listing
- `/services/:id` - Service detail page
- `/doctors` - Doctor listing
- `/doctors/:id` - Doctor detail page
- `/blog` - Blog listing
- `/blog/:slug` - Blog post page
- `/contact` - Contact page
- `/privacy-policy` - Privacy Policy
- `/terms` - Terms & Conditions
- `/licenses` - Licenses & Accreditations

### Hash Navigation
To link to specific sections on a page, use hash anchors:
```vue
<router-link to="/services#book-appt">Book Appointment</router-link>
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive with breakpoints for:
- Mobile (< 768px)
- Tablet (768px - 1024px)
- Desktop (> 1024px)

Bootstrap 5 grid system is used for responsive layouts.

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **EmailJS Keys**: The public key is safe to use in frontend code
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation prevents common issues
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
- **Email Templates**: Keep sensitive information out of email templates

## 🚀 Deployment

### Automated Deploy via GitHub Actions (recommended)

Pushes and merges to `main` automatically build and deploy to DigitalOcean using release-based atomic deployments. See [CI/CD Setup](#-cicd--github-actions) below.

### Rootlab Production Architecture

This project is deployed under:

```text
/apps/bsh/
    current/        -> symlink to active release
    releases/       -> immutable release directories
    shared/
        logs/
        tmp/
```

Deployment never writes directly into `current/`. A new release is uploaded into `releases/<release-id>/`, validated, then activated by atomically updating the `current` symlink.

### Manual Deploy to DigitalOcean

1. **Build the project**
```bash
npm run build
```

2. **Upload the `dist/` folder** to a release directory (for example `/apps/bsh/releases/<release-id>/`)

3. **Switch the active release** by updating `/apps/bsh/current` symlink

4. **Nginx** serves `/apps/bsh/current` and SPA fallback config must be enabled

5. **Set up SSL certificate** via Certbot for HTTPS (already active at basespecialisthospital.com)

### Deploy to Netlify (alternative)

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Netlify
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Publish directory: `dist`
5. Add `VITE_EMAILJS_*` env vars in Netlify dashboard
6. Deploy!

## 🚀 CI/CD — GitHub Actions

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment to DigitalOcean on every push to `main`.

### Branch Strategy

```
main          ← production-only, protected — auto-deploys to server
  └── development  ← active work branch, daily commits go here
        └── feature/xxx  ← optional per-feature branches
```

**Workflow:**
1. Do all your work on the `development` branch
2. Open a Pull Request: `development` → `main`
3. Merge the PR → GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys

### GitHub Actions Secrets Required

Go to your repo on GitHub → **Settings → Environments → production** and add:

#### Environment Secrets

| Secret Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Your deploy private key (see SSH Key Setup below) |
| `VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY` | Your EmailJS public key |
| `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID` | Your EmailJS service ID |
| `VITE_EMAILJS_CONTACT_TEMPLATE_ID` | Contact form template ID |
| `VITE_EMAILJS_APPOINTMENT_TEMPLATE_ID` | Appointment template ID |

#### Environment Variables

| Variable Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `APP_ROOT` | `/apps/bsh` |
| `SSH_HOST` | `161.35.163.18` |
| `SSH_PORT` | `22` |
| `SSH_USER` | `rootlab` |

### SSH Key Setup (one-time)

1. **Generate a dedicated deploy key** (on your local machine or server):
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions-deploy" -f ~/.ssh/bsh_deploy_key -N ""
```
This creates two files: `bsh_deploy_key` (private) and `bsh_deploy_key.pub` (public).

2. **Add the public key to your DO server** (SSH in as your normal user):
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/bsh_deploy_key.pub | ssh rootlab@161.35.163.18 "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

3. **Add the private key to GitHub Secrets** as `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/bsh_deploy_key
```
Copy the entire output (including `-----BEGIN...` and `-----END...` lines) into the GitHub Secret.

### Nginx SPA Configuration

Use the production template in `deploy/nginx/bsh.conf`.

Apply example:

```bash
sudo cp deploy/nginx/bsh.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/bsh.conf
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bsh.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/bsh.conf
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

The template includes:

- Vue Router history fallback (`try_files ... /index.html`)
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- Security headers
- Gzip compression
- Static asset caching optimization

Minimal fallback example:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    root /apps/bsh/current;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

### Deployment and Rollback Workflows

- Automatic deploy on `main`: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Manual rollback: `.github/workflows/rollback.yml`

Rollback uses release IDs from `/apps/bsh/releases` and atomically repoints `/apps/bsh/current`.

### Protect `main` Branch on GitHub

Go to your repo → **Settings → Branches → Add branch ruleset**:
- Branch name pattern: `main`
- ✅ Require a pull request before merging
- ✅ Require at least 1 approval (optional for solo projects)
- ✅ Block direct pushes
- ✅ Restrict deletions

## 📦 Dependencies
