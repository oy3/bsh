The hospitality and professionalism at base specialist is top notch. No delay with attending to patients. God bless the very experienced doctors and nurses for making delivery a wonderful experience for me.",

    "text": "Rating a 5 star because my family started using this facility several months ago and the service has been nothing short of excellent. I also had my second baby here 2 weeks ago. Throughout the antenatal process up until delivery, the doctors and nurses were very professional and empathetic. I can't count the number of times I heard the word \"sorry\" while being administered drugs, injections etc. None of my complains was treated with levity. The doctor always ensured he proferred timely solutions. The delivery process was a contrast to my first baby's delivery experience who I had in a different hospital. I felt listened to and heard at Base specialist hospital. The hygiene is also top notch and the staff are very welcoming. I definitely recommend üíØ.",
